Why do you think, man? You just FARTED in front of the entire bar!

[r]
Whaaat? No, I didn’t!

null
Crap. Yes, I did.

null
Pun intended.

null
I squirm in my seat and feel something damp and sticky rubbing against my inner thighs.

null
Oh no.

null
I didn’t just fart. I ALSO **** MYSELF.

null
I need to get out of here without drawing attention to myself, but they all think I farted just now!

null
I mean, I DID, but they don’t need to know that!

Sir, if you can’t control your bowels, I’m gonna have to ask you to leave before you stink up the whole room.

[r]
W-Wait! You don’t *hic* understand! I can’t leave.

Why not?

Uhh…

Okay, Ron. You’ve drank an insane amount of alcohol but you can’t get kicked out now. 

null
You’re smart. You’re a lawyer, dammit. Not just a lawyer - I’m a goddamn DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

null
Time to come up with a perfectly logical reason as to why I shouldn’t leave.
