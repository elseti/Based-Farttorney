Putting aside that obvious overreaction…

[w]
Is that seriously what you think? Me and this barkeep are, what, a couple?

[w]
I mean, don’t get me wrong, sir. You’re a very handsome man and that is a very handsome mustache…

Why, thank you.

[w]
But that doesn’t point to any sort of connection with us. What, because I dress nice and he does a bit of personal grooming?

[r]
Sure, it may seem like circumstantial evidence. But look at the facts.

[r]
She’s here alone, sits right up at the bar to be harassed by a creepy old man, and barely drinks anything. Why would she do that to “relax”, as she claims?

[r]
Is it possible she has some other motive? Such as… to spend some time watching her man at work?

Uh… I’d like to revisit that “harassed by a creepy old man” part?

[r]
Denied.

show lady/judge lady

[w]
Okay, look. The bartender and I aren’t lovers. And even if we were, what does that have to do with the fart?

[r]
Well, it’s obvious. You farted, and he’s obviously not gonna throw his lover out the bar.

[r]
So you’re conspiring to pin it all on me instead! The helpless, innocent, and very sober lawyer!

show lady/stressed lady

[w]
Okay, you know what? I’m tired of this. At this point, I don’t even care who farted. I’m leaving.

[w]
And since you’re so convinced that I’m the bartender’s secret lover and he’d NEVER kick me out, then I’ll prove you wrong.

show lady/cocky lady

[w]
I take responsibility for the fart, sir. So go ahead. Kick me out. This night was a bust anyway.

I’m not kicking you out, ma’am. You may stay.

Oh ****. Plot twist, baby!!

show barkeep/angry barkeep

[b]
She’s not the one who farted. She shouldn’t have to leave.

And what makes you so sure of that?

What are you doing right now?

It was me. I did it.

HUH?!?

I'm the one who farted.

So, please. Let’s drop this and not force anyone to leave the bar.

Another drink, ma’am? On the house. As an apology for spoiling your night.

[w]
Oh. Well… sure. I’d like that.

Holy crap. They do like each other!

Oh, be quiet.

So, uh… barkeep.

[b]
Hmm?

[r]
They’re not listening in anymore, so uh… you wanna tell me why you took the fall for a fart that wasn’t yours?

[b]
…

[r]
You really do like that woman, don’t you?

show barkeep/happy barkeep

[b]
… Perhaps.

[r]
You sly dog. Well, if it’s any consolation, I think she likes you too!

[r]
Why else do you think she stayed this long in such a ****** place? Er, no offense.

[r]
Clearly, she was waiting for an opening to chat you up. That, or she just wanted to watch you work.

[r]
Wow. I can’t believe I went from lawyer to matchmaker, just like that.

show barkeep/stern barkeep

[b]
Alright, enough. I’m not kicking you out for what you did, so drop the subject and just keep drinking.

[r]
Yes, sir.

null
Well, it’s not the outcome I was expecting, but he’s not kicking me out, and I successfully convinced the other patrons that fart didn’t come from me.

null
Ahhhh… yup. All in a day’s work for Ron Ansar. They don’t call me the Based Attorney for nothing.
