Yeah? Is that a crime, to want to relax after being stuck in a soulless corporate box for nine hours straight?

[r]
Nope, of course not, the workforce is a nightmare.

[r]
But also, I can’t imagine this place being relaxing in any way, shape or form, especially coming here as a woman, alone.

[r]
This guy here hasn’t stopped hitting on you or making gross comments all evening.

“Gross”?

That’s fair.

[r]
You’re sitting alone at the bar with no drink in hand.

[w]
I had a beer.

[r]
Yeah, one beer. That’s barely enough to relax anyone. It’s almost more of a courtesy drink than anything.

What are you implying? And what does that have to do with the bartender’s moustache?

Yes, I would rather like to hear the end of this bewildering argument myself.

It’s simple. Look at this woman. She’s not relaxing right now. She’s doing the furthest thing from relaxing, by stepping into this bar.

[w]
It’s because my fellow patrons are creeps, perverts and farters!

[r]
That means she’s here for another reason. What could it be?

[r]
Look at her dress. Only someone with immaculate fashion sense would know to pair a dress so gorgeous with earrings that fancy.

Now look at the bartender’s mustache. Majestic, well-trimmed, perfectly groomed to the point it almost takes a life of its own...

Isn’t it obvious? This woman and the bartender... their relationship is obvious.
