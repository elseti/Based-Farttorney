And how are you gonna do that?

[r]
I’m glad you asked.

I pull my Attorney’s badge out and pin it to my chest.

[r]
I’m a mother-****in’ ATTORNEY. 

[r]
I passed the bar. I spent thousands and thousands of dollars in tuition. I slaved away for years, studying, sacrificing friendships and lovers. 

[r]
All so I could become the accomplished lawyer that I am today. And with my hard-earned law degree, I’m going to prove that the person behind that massive, wet fart wasn’t me!

Okay, look. In the spirit of fairness, if you can prove that someone else was responsible for... you know... then you may stay, and the actual culprit will be escorted off the premises.

[r]
Hell yes!

[r]
Now, why is everyone so convinced that I’m the one who did it?
