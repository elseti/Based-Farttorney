You shut up! You’re the one that started this with your creepy fart-fetish. 

[j]
Smelling apples, my ass. You probably just made it up!

To be fair, farting is very immature behavior. Exactly what I’d expect from a college-aged male. You know, statistics show they’re the most selfish creatures on the planet.

I am literally studying to become a doctor!! I’m tryna save lives, bruh!

[r]
Save lives? Then why’d you drop a bomb on us? A stink-bomb, that is.

I didn’t do it!!

[r]
Just think. What would your parents say? Knowing that they raised a liar… and a farter?

[r]
Decades of hard work and late nights, earning enough to put you through school, only for you to waste it all on a life of debauchery and flatulence.

Goddamnit, Ron. Y’know, if I had a nickel for every time you sent a twenty-year old running from my bar in tears, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t much, but it’s weird it happened twice.

[r]
This is a good ending, right? I mean, you’d’ve sent him home anyway. He was the one who stank up the whole room.

Mhm. I’m sure he was.

The bartender doesn’t look convinced.

But whatever.

He’s not kicking me out, and I successfully convinced the other patrons that fart didn’t come from me.

null
Ahhhh… yup. All in a day’s work for Ron Ansar. They don’t call me the Based Attorney for nothing.
