Aha! Who said anything about “tiny” or “golden”? How do you know what an Attorney’s badge looks like?

Huh?

[r]
Busted.

[p]
Okay, now you’re pissing me off. I didn’t take your stupid badge!

B- Besides, I thought we were grilling him for the fart. This isn’t what I should be on trial for!

[r]
Don’t you know all criminals are the same? Pickpocketing is on the same level as farting silently and blaming an innocent person for it, you know.

null
Man, I hope that’s not true. Otherwise, I’d be facing some serious charges right about now.

[r]
I’ll bet you even farted and tried to pin the blame on me to get me kicked out. Then, I’d never find out you stole my stuff.

Alright, farting was bad enough, but thievery? In my bar? That’s a big no-no. I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.

The bartender slides a small golden pin across the counter to me.

[r]
Wait. You took it?

show barkeep/angry barkeep

[b]
Are you accusing me of thievery in my own bar?

[r]
... I take it back.

[b]
You dropped it on the floor about six drinks in. 

[b]
I could’ve corrected you, but I decided to let it slide. Truth be told, I wanted an excuse to get that man out of here anyway.

[r]
You could’ve just helped blame the fart on him with me, you know. Would’ve made this a lot easier.

show barkeep/happy barkeep

[b]
I know. But it was much more fun watching to see what you’d do.

[r]
Can’t argue with that.

Anyway. ... Another beer?

Coming right up.

He’s not kicking me out, and I successfully convinced the other patrons that fart didn’t come from me.

Ahhhh... yup. All in a day’s work for Ron Ansar. They don’t call me the Based Attorney for nothing.
