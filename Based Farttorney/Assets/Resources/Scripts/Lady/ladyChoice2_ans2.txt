show lady/stressed lady

[w]
Uh, no. That’s not why I’m here.

[r]
You sure? Coulda sworn that’s why you said you were here.

[w]
Does it look like I’m working? I’m sitting alone at the bar.

[r]
Oh, but you are working. Working your magic, that is!

show lady/judge lady

[w]
What.

[r]
See, your job is actually... a secret assassin! Your target was the bartender.

[b]
What.

[r]
You’re actually a specialized hitman - or hitwoman, mind you - and your secret weapon? Deadly farts.

show lady/happy lady

[w]
Psh... that’s silly...

[r]
You tried to get him killed by unleashing a nasty, wet one right in his direction! But you got caught cos it was too loud, and now you’re trying to pin it all on me!

Daaaaamn!

switchCamera Lady

show lady/stressed lady

[w]
This is... ridiculous.

[r]
Is it, really? Is it?

[w]
Yeah, I mean... get real. 

[w]
If I were a secret assassin, which I’m not, what makes you think I’d choose such a nonsensical method of murder?

show lady/cocky lady

[w]
Obviously, if I wanted to kill the bartender, I’d offer to buy him a drink, slip one of the cyanide pills in my purse into it when he isn’t looking, toast him, down my drink and immediately leave-

[w]
-wait until he collapses, head back inside, loot his body, make off with all the money in the cash register, take a taxi to the airport and get on the next flight to Paris, all within the hour.

show lady/stressed lady

[w]
But, since I haven’t done all that, I’m clearly not a secret assassin.

[r]
Wow, you really gave that random scenario a lot of thought, huh?

switchCamera Barkeep

show barkeep/sad barkeep

[b]
Unnervingly well-thought out plans to murder me aside... the lady did clearly state she was not here for work.

show barkeep/muscles barkeep

[b]
If you have nothing more to add to your defense, sir, I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.

[r]
Ah, crap.
